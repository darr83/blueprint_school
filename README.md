# Blueprint Hospital

A realistic, NHS-inspired hospital management simulation for Windows, built with
**Godot 4.7 (.NET)** and **C#**. Players build a hospital, run an A&E with Red / Amber / Green
triage, and follow real patients through investigation, diagnosis, treatment and discharge.

> Educational simulation only. Medical content is informed by UK clinical practice but is not
> clinical guidance.

The rules of the game live in `src/` as plain C#, so they can be tested quickly without
starting Godot. The `game/` project only draws the world and handles input.

## Opening and running the game

You need:

- **Godot 4.7.2 .NET** (the "mono" download), e.g. `Godot_v4.7.2-stable_mono_win64.exe`.
- **.NET 8 SDK** – https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0

Then:

1. Start Godot, choose **Import**, and select `game/project.godot`.
2. Press **Build** (hammer icon, top right) once, then **Run Project** (F5).

## How the A&E works

Time runs at **15 game seconds per real second** at 1x (a game hour takes 4 real minutes at 1x,
1 minute at 4x). Patients arrive on a realistic daily pattern, about 35 a day: quiet overnight,
busiest from late morning to evening.

- **Walk-ins** queue at reception, are registered, then wait to be called to triage.
  **Ambulance** patients wait on the crew's trolley in the bay until a nurse takes handover,
  however long that takes.
- **Corridor care**: if there is no free cubicle once handover is done, a nurse wheels the trolley to
  a space along an A&E corridor (clear of doors and junctions) and does observations there, which
  give the Red / Amber / Green rating. The ambulance crew are then free to go. Corridor patients get
  repeat observations but no treatment, and wait for a cubicle in triage order like everyone else.
  The A&E board shows how many are in corridor care.
- **Triage** uses observations and **NEWS2** to give a **Red / Amber / Green** category. Some
  complaints trigger protocol tests at triage (an ECG for chest pain); an abnormal ECG upgrades the
  patient to Red.
- Patients go to **Resus** (Red), **Majors** (Amber) or **Minors** (Green) when a space is free.
  Sicker patients take priority: a Red patient goes to a Majors cubicle if Resus is full, and
  lower-priority patients are kept out of spaces a sicker patient is waiting for.
- **Staff choose their own work** from a task board, by clinical priority: Red emergencies,
  deteriorating Amber patients, ongoing Red care, handovers, triage, routine Amber, Green, then
  admin. They walk to the patient to do each task, get tired, take breaks, and are refreshed at
  the 08:00 and 20:00 shift changes.
- **Doctors** take a history, build a differential diagnosis from what they know (symptoms,
  observations and results, never the hidden true condition), order tests, wait for results,
  and commit to a diagnosis. Tired, junior or overloaded doctors make more mistakes, and a missed
  diagnosis can bring the patient back.
- **Treatment** follows the diagnosis, with allergy checks before every medicine. Patients are
  then discharged or transferred (e.g. a heart attack to a heart attack centre for PCI).
- Untreated patients **deteriorate**. Repeat observations pick this up and upgrade their category.
- **Red monitors need someone at the bedside and a doctor's review.** A bed, cubicle or bay monitor
  turns red when the patient's NEWS2 reaches 7 (or on a Red triage not yet stabilised), and stays
  red until NEWS2 is back to 5 or less. The most urgent jobs on the board then send a **healthcare
  assistant** to sit with them one-to-one (doing their obs, taking no breaks) until the monitor
  clears, and a doctor (or the ICU anaesthetist) to review them at the bedside, who then moves on.
  Only with both does the patient get better: quickly once the right treatment is in, slowly
  otherwise. Until then they keep getting worse, even after treatment. With no healthcare
  assistants, a nurse sits with them after 10 minutes. A stabilised Red patient's border shows amber.

The **A&E board** (left) shows patients by category, waits, ambulances, cubicle use and the
4-hour figure. Click any notification to open that patient's record.

> Saves store everything: the hospital, date, camera, rooms, building, money and accounts, every
> patient (with their full record, where they are and what they are waiting for), staff, tasks,
> ambulances and statistics. A loaded game carries on exactly where it stopped.

## Building the hospital

The game has two modes. In **Play mode** clicking picks patients, staff and beds; rooms and
furniture can't be picked. In **Build mode** (press **B** or use the switch in the top bar) the
build menu opens and clicking picks rooms, furniture and equipment; people can't be picked.
The selected room or item is outlined in blue.

Press **B** to go into build mode and open the build menu. Every room is built from a **template** in
`game/Data/RoomTemplates`, with furniture from `game/Data/Furniture`, all at real sizes in metres.

- **Build bar:** in build mode a bar of icons runs along the bottom of the screen. **Building**
  holds extensions, new floors, corridors, waiting chairs, lifts and stairs; then there is one
  icon per department (A&E, Medicine, Surgery, ICU/HDU, Cardiology, ...) and per shared service
  (Clinics, Imaging, Theatres, Pharmacy, Facilities), each with its colour across the top like a
  hospital sign. Clicking an icon pops up a row of its rooms; rooms used by several departments
  (theatre, X-ray, nurses' station...) appear in each and are tagged *Shared*. Hover a room for
  its description, sizes, cost, staffing and how it grows; click it, then drag on the floor. A
  locked department shows a padlock, and its pop-up has the button to open it. Esc closes the
  pop-up. The icons and their rooms are listed in `game/Data/BuildMenu/build_menu.json`; a room
  template that isn't listed there is added to its own department's icon automatically.
- **Decorating:** Build bar → **Decorate** (next to Building), then click any room or corridor
  to open its Decorate panel. Floors: standard, vinyl sheet, safety vinyl, ceramic tiles, wood
  planks, terrazzo, carpet tiles or chequer; walls: standard, paint, two-tone, stripe, wall tiles
  or wood panelling, each in a colour (or the finish's usual colour for that room). Each pick
  shows in the world straight away; **Apply** pays for it by floor area (£12–£55 per m² for
  floors, £6–£30 for walls). Tick *Use this look for every new ...* to give new rooms of that
  type the same look. New rooms start with a finish that suits them (safety vinyl and two-tone
  walls on wards and cubicles, tiles in toilets and theatres, wood in staff rooms, and so on);
  lifts and stairs can't be decorated. Finishes only change the look.

- **Rooms** (A&E: Minors and Majors cubicles, Resus bay, Triage room, Waiting room; Staff:
  doctors' office, nurses' station, staff room) are **dragged out from corner to corner at any
  size**, in half-metre steps, above each type's minimum and below its maximum (both on its
  hover card). Either side can be the long one. The hover card shows what the room holds at a
  few example sizes before you build.
- **Placing:** while you drag, a see-through preview shows the furniture and door. It is
  **green** with the price when it can be built and **red** with the reasons when it can't:
  outside the building, overlapping another room, too small or too big, not touching a corridor,
  cutting off another room or an entrance, or not enough money. Release the mouse to build.
- **Doors are automatic:** the door goes on the wall with the longest stretch touching a corridor
  (or the waiting room), centred on that stretch. A waiting room that lines up with the main
  entrance also gets a street door.
- **Furniture adapts** to the room: beds, monitors and chairs keep their real size, and a bigger
  waiting room or office simply gets more seats.
- **Corridors** are dragged out to any size, corner to corner (at least 2 m wide). Each must touch
  or cross another corridor or an entrance; where corridors overlap they simply join up, and only
  the new floor is paid for. Every room's door must open onto a corridor (or the waiting room).
- **Routes (R):** shows a dotted line from everyone who is walking to where they are going,
  patients in their triage colour and staff in their uniform colour. Whoever is selected always
  shows their route.
- **Rotate (Q / E):** turns the view a quarter turn, so the hospital can be seen from all four sides.
- **Extending the building:** drag out new floor on any side, onto grass or paving. Entrances, the
  car park and the ambulance bay must be kept clear.
- **Room panel:** in build mode, click a room's floor to see its details and who is using it, rename it, move or
  resize it (it keeps its name), or demolish it for a 50% refund. Rooms in use can't be moved or
  demolished, and the department always keeps at least one waiting room and one triage room.
- **Money:** a new hospital has £750,000 to build with, shown in the top bar.

### Money

The balance in the top bar is the hospital's money. Click it (or press **F**) for the finances:
today, yesterday and the last week by category, and what the hospital costs to run each day.

- **Income** is a simplified NHS tariff: each A&E attendance earns £450 (Red), £250 (Amber) or
  £130 (Green) when the patient leaves A&E, and each ward admission earns £1,200 plus £300 a night
  when the patient goes home. Each operation earns £2,500. Patients who leave without being seen
  earn nothing.
- **Running costs:** wages for every post (each covered around the clock, about 4.5 people per
  post), building upkeep of £0.60 per m² a day, and every test and medicine as it is used.
  Without a pharmacy, medicines cost 50% more.
- **Building work** is paid up front. If the money runs out, building stops until it comes back.

### Conditions

The game has 76 A&E conditions (plus the maternity ones), each with its own symptoms, observations,
tests, treatment and outcome. Doctors only see what a real doctor would: symptoms, observations and test results.
Children's illnesses (croup, bronchiolitis, febrile convulsion) are seen in A&E.

"Admit" goes to a ward bed when there is one, otherwise to another hospital. "Operation" goes to
theatre and then a ward bed; without a theatre the patient is transferred. "Transfer" goes to a
specialist centre elsewhere (heart attack centre, neurosurgery).

### Departments

Every condition belongs to a department (`"department"` in its data). **A&E**, **Acute and General
Medicine** and the shared services (imaging, theatres, pharmacy) are open from the start. The other
specialties (Cardiology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, General Surgery, Gynaecology, Trauma and
Orthopaedics, and Critical Care) are
locked: unlock one in **Build → Departments** by paying its opening cost, and its rooms (such as its
ward) appear in the build menu. Then hire its team.

- Admitted patients go to a ward of **their own specialty**: heart failure to a Cardiology ward,
  pneumonia to a Medical ward. If the hospital has no ward for that specialty, they are transferred
  to a neighbouring hospital, even if another ward has room.
- The **A&E ward** belongs to A&E. When a patient's specialty ward is full they wait there instead of
  in a cubicle. Patients who need a few hours of observation before going home (anaphylaxis,
  hypoglycaemia, a seizure, asthma, a faint: `observe_hours` in the condition data) move there too,
  freeing their cubicle; with no free bed they go home from the cubicle as before. Patients back from
  theatre can recover there if their specialty has no ward.

### Wards

Build a **Medical ward** (Build → Wards) to admit patients who need more than a few hours of care,
such as pneumonia. Specialty wards (Cardiology ward and so on) and the A&E ward are built the same
way. Drag it out like any room: beds go in a row along the wall opposite the door,
2.5 m apart, each with a bedside locker. From **7.5 m deep** a second row faces the first across
the aisle, so a longer or deeper ward holds more beds. The build menu shows how many beds each size
gives.

- **Ward team:** a new ward comes empty. Recruitment recommends one nurse for every 6 beds and a
  doctor; hire them onto the ward and they look after that ward's patients. Until a ward has its
  own nurse or doctor, the A&E team covers it. If the ward is demolished, its staff move to A&E.
- **Admission:** when an A&E doctor decides a patient needs admitting, the patient waits in their
  cubicle until a bed on their specialty's ward (or the A&E ward) is free, then a nurse takes them up. Leaving A&E for the ward stops the
  4-hour clock. A full ward blocks A&E cubicles, as in a real hospital; the A&E board shows ward
  beds and anyone waiting for one. After 6 hours without a bed, or if there is no ward for their
  specialty, the patient is transferred to a neighbouring hospital.
- **On the ward:** the ward doctor clerks each admission (and may spot and correct a wrong A&E
  diagnosis), nurses do observations, and a ward round decides when the patient is well enough to
  go home. Each condition sets its usual length of stay (`length_of_stay_hours`).
- A ward with a booked bed or a patient in it can't be moved or demolished.

### Imaging, theatres and pharmacy

Build these from **Build → Services**. Each room opens once you hire someone to work in it (see
**Staff and recruitment**); if it is demolished, they wait for a new room of the same kind.

- **X-ray room** (radiographer): chest X-rays and X-rays of injured limbs. **CT scanner** (CT
  radiographer): CT head and CT pulmonary angiogram. The patient is taken from their cubicle to the
  scanner and back, and a radiologist reports the scan after a short wait. Without the room, doctors
  diagnose without that scan: a broken ankle or a bleed on the brain is much easier to miss.
- **Operating theatre** (consultant surgeon **and** anaesthetist): appendicectomy, ectopic pregnancy,
  hip fracture and the other General Surgery operations. A theatre only opens with both a surgeon and
  an anaesthetist posted to it, and the anaesthetist stays for the whole operation. The patient waits in their cubicle for theatre, has the operation, then needs a ward
  bed to recover in. If the A&E diagnosis was wrong, the surgeon finds out in theatre. Each theatre
  only takes the departments ticked in its room panel (General Surgery for appendicitis, Gynaecology
  for ectopic pregnancy, Trauma and Orthopaedics for hip fractures, or All departments); a new theatre
  has none ticked. Patients whose department has no theatre are transferred.
- **Pharmacy** (pharmacist): buys medicines at list price and dispenses ward patients' medicines to
  take home. Without one, medicines cost 50% more and every ward discharge waits about 4 hours for
  medicines from an outside pharmacy.

The simulation works with whatever you build: any number of cubicles, triage rooms, offices and
staff rooms.

### Specialty rooms and wards

Build these from **Build → Specialty rooms** and **Build → Wards** once their department is unlocked.
Each specialty room opens when you hire its specialist (posted to the room).

| Room | Department | Run by | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Echo room | Cardiology | Cardiac physiologist | Echocardiograms for heart failure, AF and heart attacks |
| Cath lab | Cardiology | Cardiac physiologist | Primary PCI for heart attacks on site instead of transfer; they then recover on a cardiology ward or the CCU |
| EEG room | Neurology | Neurophysiologist | EEGs after a seizure |
| Early pregnancy unit | Gynaecology | Sonographer | Pelvic ultrasound for suspected ectopic pregnancy and threatened miscarriage |
| Endoscopy room | Gastroenterology | Endoscopist | OGD for bleeding from the stomach |
| Endoscopy recovery bay | Gastroenterology | No staff of its own | Patients come round from sedation here for 30 minutes; without a free bay they recover on the endoscopy trolley and the room waits |
| Plaster room | Trauma and Orthopaedics | Plaster technician | Plaster backslabs for broken ankles; without a technician A&E nurses plaster in the cubicle |
| Physio gym | Trauma and Orthopaedics | Physiotherapist | Physios visit ward patients after a broken hip or a stroke (up to 4 sessions), and each session brings their discharge forward |

The doctors in A&E order these tests when they help with the diagnosis and the room is staffed;
the patient is taken there and the report follows. The **Coronary care unit** (Cardiology),
**Stroke unit** (Neurology) and **Acute medical unit** (General Medicine) are wards for that
department's patients.

The **Ambulatory care unit** (General Medicine, under Wards) gives same-day emergency care. A patient
who would be admitted with a clot on the lung, fast AF, a kidney infection or a chest infection, and
who is not Red, goes there instead of a ward when it has a free bed: a few hours of treatment, then
home to finish it with a review the next day. If they are not well enough by the ward round they are
admitted after all. Other patients never use the unit's beds.

### General Surgery

Unlock **General Surgery** (£225,000) for appendicitis, gallbladder problems, pancreatitis, bowel
obstruction, perforated ulcers, strangulated hernias and abscesses. Tick General Surgery on a theatre
so its patients can be operated on.

- **Surgical assessment unit:** A&E sends patients who need an operation here to wait for theatre in a
  bed, freeing their cubicle (with no free bed they wait in A&E as before). After the operation they
  move to the surgical ward.
- **Surgical ward:** recovery after surgery, and care for gallbladder, pancreatitis and bowel patients.
- **Day surgery unit:** after a small operation (draining an abscess) the patient comes round here and
  goes home the same day if they are well enough on the ward round.
- **Surgical clinic:** booked follow-ups, using the clinic calendar.

### Critical Care (ICU and HDU)

Unlock **Critical Care** (£300,000). Every patient has a level of care: a ward, high dependency (HDU)
or intensive care (ICU).

- **Intensive care unit:** a ventilator and monitor at every bed and a nurse for each patient. It only
  takes patients while an **anaesthetist** is posted to it; the anaesthetist does the doctor's work
  there. Very sick patients being admitted (septic shock, or anyone at severity 0.7 or more) need ICU;
  without an open ICU they are transferred to a neighbouring hospital's ICU.
- **High dependency unit:** a nurse for every two patients and a doctor. Patients go there after a
  major operation (a laparotomy) and when they are sick but not ICU-sick. Without an HDU they are
  looked after on an ordinary ward, as before.
- **Critical care outreach office:** the outreach nurse goes to ward patients who are getting worse
  and moves them up to HDU or ICU (and sometimes spots a wrong diagnosis). Without outreach, only the
  ward round notices.
- **Stepping down:** the ICU and HDU rounds move patients down as they get better: ICU, then HDU, then
  a ward, then home. A patient keeps their bed until the next one is free. Organ support slows a
  patient's decline (most on ICU), and each day on ICU (£1,800) or HDU (£900) is paid for on top of
  the admission.

### Maternity

Unlock **Maternity** (£250,000) in Build → Departments, then build its rooms from **Build → Maternity**.
Midwives (Band 5 to Band 8 consultant midwife) are a new staff type in Recruitment.

| Room | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery room | One woman in labour at a time with her midwife: a birthing bed, CTG monitor, cot, resuscitaire and birthing ball |
| Mother and baby ward | A cot beside every bed. Women in labour wait here for a delivery room, and come back here with their baby. One midwife for every 6 beds |
| Neonatal unit | An incubator and monitor for each baby, and a nurse for every two babies |
| C-section theatre | Caesarean sections only, for Maternity only; needs a surgeon and an anaesthetist |
| Antenatal clinic | Booked pregnancy check-ups, run by a midwife (needs an Outpatients reception) |
| Pregnancy scan room | Booked 12 and 20 week scans and growth scans, run by a sonographer |

- **Opening:** the unit takes women once it has a delivery room with a midwife posted to it and a
  mother and baby ward. Until then, and whenever every bed is full, women go to a neighbouring hospital.
- **Labour:** women in labour skip A&E and go straight to a ward bed, then walk to a free delivery
  room. About 1 in 8 labours ends in an emergency caesarean in the C-section theatre (or a forceps
  delivery if there is no theatre). Breech babies, severe pre-eclampsia and placental abruption go
  straight to theatre, so they are sent elsewhere without one.
- **Babies** are born with a name, sex and weight (lighter the earlier they come), lie on mum's chest
  for skin-to-skin, then sleep in the cot beside her bed and go home with her. Premature or poorly
  babies are carried to the neonatal unit by one of its nurses, and back to mum when they are well;
  without a neonatal unit (or a free incubator) they are transferred out. A baby can stay on the unit
  after mum goes home. Click mum to see her babies in her record, and rename them there.
- **Money:** £1,900 for a birth, £3,800 for a caesarean and £1,100 for each day on the neonatal unit
  (**Maternity** in Finances).
- **Medical data:** labour conditions live in `game/Data/Conditions/maternity_conditions.json` with a
  `maternity` block (weeks pregnant, chances of twins, an emergency caesarean or the neonatal unit,
  neonatal reasons and stay). The medical editor edits these too.

### Upper floors, lifts and stairs

- **Adding a floor:** Build bar → Building → *Add a floor* (or the **+▲** button on the right,
  which opens the Building pop-up). A new floor has the same outline as the ground floor and costs £500 per m²
  of outline for the first floor up, £100 per m² more for each floor higher, plus every lift and
  staircase carried up to it. The building can be up to five floors (ground + 4). Extending the
  building later grows every floor, and the extension is paid for on each floor.
- **Seeing a floor:** Page Up / Page Down or the ▲ ▼ buttons. Only that floor's rooms and people are
  drawn; upstairs, the grounds show faded below. Clicking someone in the Patients or Staff list
  switches to their floor.
- **Lifts and stairs** (Build → Lifts & stairs) are dragged out like a room on any floor and go
  through every floor, in the same place, including floors added later; they are paid for on each
  floor. Their door must open onto a corridor on at least one floor. Upstairs, a corridor starts
  from the landing outside a lift or stair door. They can't be moved; demolishing one takes it out
  of every floor.
- **Who uses what:** people on foot take whichever is quicker: stairs cost about 10 s a floor, the
  lift about 12 s of waiting plus 2.5 s a floor, so walkers take the stairs for one floor and the lift
  for more. Wheelchairs, trolleys, beds and ambulance stretchers only change floor by lift, and the
  porter rides up with them. So a room patients are brought to (a ward, theatre, scanner or clinic)
  can only be built upstairs once a lift reaches it; staff-only rooms (offices, staff room,
  pharmacy) are fine with just stairs.
- **Saves:** the floor count and every lift and staircase are saved (save format 4). Older saves load
  as a one-floor building.

### Cafeteria and vending points

Build these from **Build → Facilities**. They need no staff: catering is run by an outside
contractor, and the hospital gets a share of the takings (**Cafe and vending** in Finances).

| Room | Smallest | Furniture (placed automatically) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cafeteria | 5 × 5 m | A food counter with a till on the back wall, a water machine beside it, vending machines down the side walls (1 in a small cafe, then 2, 3 and 4 as it grows past about 40, 65 and 100 m²) and tables of four filling the floor |
| Vending point | 2 × 2.5 m | Vending machines along the back wall (one for each 1.1 m or so, up to 4), a water machine, and a seat or two if it is deep enough |

Walking patients waiting in A&E (Green or Amber, after 20 minutes) and checked-in clinic patients
whose appointment is at least 25 minutes off now and then go to a cafe or vending point (the
nearest, though people will walk further for a cafe), buy something (£2 to £3 from a machine, £4 to
£6 at the counter), sit at a table to eat if it's a cafe, and go back to their seat. If they are
called while they're away they go straight to the call. Having had something to eat or drink makes
a patient half as likely to leave without being seen for the next 3 hours.

### Toilets

Build these from **Build → Facilities**. They have no staff; cleaning is part of the building's upkeep.

| Room | Smallest | Furniture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toilets | 3 × 3 m | Cubicles along the back wall (about one per metre of wall, up to 6), wash basins with mirrors (one per two cubicles) and a hand dryer |
| Accessible toilet | 2.5 × 2.5 m | A toilet with grab rails and a red emergency pull cord, and a basin |
| Staff toilet | 1.5 × 2.5 m | A toilet and a basin, for staff only |

Walking patients waiting in A&E (after 30 minutes) and checked-in clinic patients need the toilet
now and then (about every two hours, twice as often after a drink from the cafe). They walk to the
nearest free toilet, wait just inside the door if every cubicle is busy (for up to 15 minutes),
wash their hands and go back to their seat. Someone in a cubicle is hidden and its door latch shows
red. Patients aged 75 or over use the accessible toilet first. Staff on a break sometimes pop to the
staff toilet, or to the public ones when there isn't one.

With no public toilets, waiting patients are 50% more likely to leave without being seen. A
patient who can't get to a toilet (none built, or they gave up queueing) has a 5% chance of an
accident on the floor (three times that for children under 12): a wet patch with a yellow sign is
left until the cleaners mop it up 30 minutes later.

### Outpatient clinics

Build these from **Build → Clinics**: an **Outpatients reception** (desk and seats) and one or more
clinic rooms (medical, cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, surgical, gynaecology, gynaecology
examination room and fracture clinic). Specialty clinics need their department unlocked first.

- A clinic runs with a **doctor posted to it** and a **receptionist posted to Outpatients
  reception** (choose the posting when hiring). Without them its appointments are cancelled and a
  notification says what is missing.
- Each running clinic keeps a **calendar**, booked for today and tomorrow, Monday to Friday, in two
  sessions: 09:00 to 12:00 and 13:30 to 16:30. Slot length and payment depend on the clinic
  (`Data/Clinics/clinics.json`). About 85% of slots are booked; about 8% of patients don't attend
  and some arrive late.
- Patients walk in from the car park a little before their time, queue at the Outpatients desk, are
  checked in by the receptionist, then sit on a free chair: in Outpatients reception or on **chairs
  placed in the corridors** (£120 each; doorways must stay clear). With no free chair they stand.
- The clinic doctor calls each patient in at their appointment time, sees them, and they go home.
  The hospital is paid per patient seen (Clinics in the finances).
- Some appointments are **procedures** (a smear test, colposcopy, coil fitting, mole removal, cast
  change, pacemaker check). Each has its own length and fee; a long one takes as many slots as it
  needs. The Clinics panel marks them "Procedure".
- Open **Clinics** (C) to see each clinic's calendar: who is booked, arriving, waiting (and for how
  long), in clinic, seen or did not attend. Click a patient's name to find them on the map. Clinic
  patients have a lilac ring.

### Planned day lists

Alongside the emergencies, the hospital runs **planned lists** on weekdays. Each morning it books
patients for the day (arriving 07:30 to 13:00) for every list that can run:

| Procedure | Department | Done in |
|---|---|---|
| Inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy | General Surgery | a theatre ticked for General Surgery |
| Carpal tunnel release, knee arthroscopy | Trauma & Orthopaedics | a theatre ticked for T&O |
| Hysteroscopy | Gynaecology | a theatre ticked for Gynaecology |
| Coronary angiogram | Cardiology | the cath lab |
| Gastroscopy (OGD), colonoscopy | Gastroenterology | the endoscopy room |

- A list needs its department, a staffed room for it (a surgeon and an anaesthetist in theatre, a
  cardiac physiologist in the cath lab, an endoscopist in the endoscopy room) and a **day surgery
  unit**. More staffed rooms mean more patients per day.
- Planned patients skip A&E: they walk straight onto the day surgery unit, go for their procedure
  when the room is free, recover there for a few hours and go home. Each pays its own fee
  (Operations in the finances).
- **Emergencies come first.** Emergency patients take the theatre ahead of the list, and each day
  surgery unit keeps a quarter of its beds (at least one) free for emergency day cases.
- A planned patient is **cancelled** if there is no spare day surgery bed when they arrive, if the
  room or its staff are lost, or if their procedure hasn't started by 18:00. Each cancellation costs
  reputation and shows a notification.
- The Clinics panel (C) shows the day's planned lists and what each closed list still needs.

### Starting a new game

**New Game** asks how to start:

- **Small A&E with a team:** cubicles, resus, triage, offices and a starting team of 9 (a receptionist,
  4 nurses, 2 doctors and 2 porters). Patients arrive straight away.
- **Empty building:** just the building, the roads and a waiting room with reception, plus the value
  of the starter rooms in the bank. You build and hire everything. A&E stays closed to new patients
  (the A&E board says what it still needs) until it has a triage room, a cubicle or resus bay, an A&E
  nurse and an A&E doctor. It also closes if you take any of these away.

Tick **Unlimited money** on the New Game screen to keep building, unlocking and hiring when the
balance goes below zero. Money and the finances are still counted and shown as normal.

### Staff and recruitment

- **Grades:** nurses are Band 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 by how good they are (Band 7 and above wear navy);
  doctors are Junior Doctor, Doctor, Registrar or Consultant. Radiographers, surgeons, pharmacists,
  cardiac physiologists, neurophysiologists, sonographers, endoscopists, porters and receptionists
  have one grade each. Any nurse or doctor can work in A&E or on any ward.
- **Healthcare assistants** (Band 3, grey tunic) work in A&E or on a ward. They sit one-to-one with
  patients whose monitor has gone red, so doctors are free to review and move on. The recommended
  team is at least one in A&E (more as cubicles grow) and one per ward; the small A&E start has one
  on each shift.
- **Recruitment** (H) lists a fresh set of candidates every 4 game hours (00:00, 04:00, 08:00 ...):
  at least one of every kind of staff, plus a second choice for the kinds you are short of, with their
  grade, skill, experience, pace and salary. Choose where each will work and press Hire. Rooms never come
  with staff: everyone is hired by you.
- **Recommended team:** the same panel shows, for A&E, porters and each room, how many of each kind
  of staff it recommends and how many you have. It's a guide only.
- **Names:** press **Rename** on a member of staff's or a patient's card to change their name. Rooms
  are renamed by typing in the name box on the room panel.
- **Letting staff go:** open their card and press Let go twice. Whatever they were doing goes back
  on the board for someone else.

### Moving patients

- Patients who can walk, walk. Patients who can't wait where they are until a **porter** pushes
  them: on a **trolley** if they are Red, are going to theatre, or came by ambulance and aren't fit
  to sit; in a **wheelchair** if they came by ambulance and are fit to sit (Green), are Amber and
  aged 75 or over, or are being admitted. Everyone walks out when they go home.
- Ambulance crews wheel their own patients in from the bay on their stretcher.
- Free porters wait in the staff room (in a corridor if there isn't one).
- The game starts with two porters. With none, a nurse does the pushing; a nurse also steps in
  if a move has waited 10 minutes for a porter.

## Building an executable

1. In Godot: **Editor → Manage Export Templates → Download and Install** (once).
2. **Project → Export…**, choose the **Windows Desktop** preset, then **Export Project**.
   The preset writes to `builds/windows/BlueprintSchool.exe` and already includes the
   `Data/*.json` files.

## Tests

```bash
# Unit tests for the simulation library
dotnet test tests/BlueprintSchool.Simulation.Tests

# Launch check: starts a game, checks patients arrive and are triaged and staff work,
# opens a patient record, saves, reloads and verifies, then exits 0/1
godot --headless --path game -- --smoke-test

# Same, with screenshots (needs a display, not --headless)
godot --path game -- --smoke-test --screenshots=/some/folder

# Run the A&E without graphics: hours, random seed, arrival multiplier, print N patient journeys
dotnet run --project tools/SimulationRunner -- 72 1 1.0 3
```

The simulation runner is the quickest way to check balance after changing content: it prints the
department each hour, then arrivals, outcomes, 4-hour performance, diagnostic accuracy and how
hard each member of staff worked.

GitHub Actions runs both on every pull request (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Adding content

All content is loaded from `game/Data/` when the game starts and is checked before play.
If anything is wrong, the main menu lists every problem with its file, record and field,
for example:

```
Symptoms/core_symptoms.json record 'fever', field 'name': is required and must not be empty.
```

General rules for every data folder:

- Each `.json` file holds an **array** of records. Split content across as many files as you like;
  every `.json` file in the folder is loaded.
- Every record needs a unique `id`: lowercase letters, digits and underscores, starting with a letter
  (e.g. `chest_pain`). Other data refers to records by this id.
- Field names are `snake_case`. Misspelt or unknown fields are rejected rather than ignored.

### Medical data editor

`tools/MedicalEditor/MedicalEditor.html` edits every illness, symptom, test and medicine in one place.
Open it in Chrome or Edge, press **Open game data**, pick the Blueprint Hospital folder (or `game/Data`)
and allow editing. Each illness page shows its symptoms, observations, severity, key tests, how each
test reports it, treatment and outcome; tests, symptoms and medicines link back to the illnesses that
use them. Problems the game would reject are flagged as you type with the same rules as the loader.
**Save changes** writes straight back into the JSON files (only the files you changed), so the JSON stays
the single source of truth. Renaming an id updates every reference. Browsers that can't write to
folders download the changed files instead.

### How to add a symptom

Add an entry to any file in `game/Data/Symptoms/`:

```json
{
  "id": "cough",
  "name": "Cough",
  "patient_description": "I can't stop coughing.",
  "body_system": "respiratory",
  "is_red_flag": false
}
```

`body_system` is one of: `general`, `cardiovascular`, `respiratory`, `gastrointestinal`,
`neurological`, `gynaecological`, `musculoskeletal`, `skin`.

### How to create a new department

Add an entry to any file in `game/Data/Departments/`:

```json
{
  "id": "respiratory",
  "name": "Respiratory Medicine",
  "short_name": "RESP",
  "description": "Treats conditions of the lungs and airways.",
  "colour": "#00897B",
  "starts_unlocked": false,
  "is_shared_service": false,
  "opening_cost": 220000
}
```

Exactly one department (A&E) has `starts_unlocked: true`. Departments with an `opening_cost` of 0,
and shared services (`is_shared_service`, such as Radiology), are also open from the start; the
rest are unlocked in game by paying their opening cost. Give the department a ward by adding a room
template with `"kind": "ward"` and its `"department"`.

Add `"triage_investigations": ["ecg"]` to a symptom to make triage nurses request those tests
whenever a patient has it.

### How to add a condition

Add an entry to any file in `game/Data/Conditions/`. This is a complete example:

```json
{
  "id": "simple_laceration",
  "name": "Simple laceration",
  "department": "emergency",
  "description": "A clean cut to the skin that needs cleaning and closing.",
  "prevalence": 6,
  "age_range": [4, 85],
  "female_fraction": 0.4,
  "ambulance_probability": 0.03,
  "presenting_complaint": "bleeding_wound",
  "symptoms": [ { "symptom": "bleeding_wound", "probability": 1.0 } ],
  "observations": {
    "heart_rate": [84, 9], "systolic_bp": [126, 11], "diastolic_bp": [78, 8],
    "respiratory_rate": [15, 2], "oxygen_saturation": [98.5, 0.8],
    "temperature": [36.7, 0.3], "pain_score": [2, 5]
  },
  "initial_severity": [0.05, 0.12],
  "deterioration_per_hour": 0,
  "deterioration_effects": { "heart_rate": 0, "systolic_bp": 0, "respiratory_rate": 0, "oxygen_saturation": 0, "temperature": 0 },
  "can_be_fatal": false,
  "key_investigations": [],
  "treatment": [
    { "type": "procedure", "name": "Wound cleaning and closure", "performed_by": "doctor", "minutes": 20, "essential": true },
    { "type": "medication", "medication": "paracetamol", "essential": false }
  ],
  "recovery_per_hour": 0.5,
  "disposition": "discharge",
  "disposition_note": "Discharged after wound closure with wound care advice."
}
```

- `prevalence` is how common the condition is relative to the others (it is also the doctors'
  prior belief). `symptoms` lists each symptom with the chance a patient has it; the
  `presenting_complaint` must be one of them, with probability 1.
- `observations` give the mean and spread of each vital sign; `pain_score` is a min/max range.
- `initial_severity` (0–1) and `deterioration_per_hour` control how ill patients are and how fast
  they get worse untreated; `deterioration_effects` is how much each vital sign shifts at full severity.
  Severity 1 is fatal if `can_be_fatal` is true.
- `key_investigations` are the tests doctors order to confirm or rule out this condition.
- `treatment` steps are done in order. `essential` steps must be given for the patient to recover.
- `disposition` is `discharge`, `transfer`, `admit` or `surgery`, with a note shown in the record.
  `surgery` also needs `"operation": { "name": "Laparoscopic appendicectomy", "minutes": 60 }`.
  Optional: `"ambulatory_hours": [4, 8]` for an `admit` condition that can be managed the same day in an
  ambulatory care unit, and `"needs_physio": true` for ward patients who need physiotherapy to get home.
  A treatment procedure can name `"room": "plaster_room"` to be done there by a plaster technician.
- A **planned** procedure (see `Conditions/planned_procedures.json`) is a `surgery` condition with a
  day-case `operation` and `"planned": { "per_day": [1, 3], "tariff": 2400 }`: patients are booked onto
  weekday lists (`per_day` for each staffed room) and never come through A&E. Its operation `room` can
  also be `endoscopy`.

### How to add an investigation

Add an entry to any file in `game/Data/Investigations/`:

```json
{
  "id": "troponin",
  "name": "High-sensitivity troponin",
  "category": "blood",
  "performed_by": "nurse",
  "procedure_minutes": 5,
  "turnaround_minutes": 60,
  "cost": 25,
  "applies_to_sex": "any",
  "unit": "ng/L",
  "normal": { "value_range": [2, 14], "summaries": ["Troponin {value} ng/L (normal, below 14)."] },
  "false_positive_rate": 0.03,
  "false_positive": { "value_range": [15, 40], "summaries": ["Troponin {value} ng/L (mildly raised)."] },
  "abnormal": [
    { "condition": "acute_myocardial_infarction", "probability": 0.95,
      "value_range": [60, 3000], "summaries": ["Troponin {value} ng/L (markedly raised)."] }
  ],
  "escalate_to_red_if_abnormal": false
}
```

Results are generated from the patient's **true** condition: for each `abnormal` entry,
`probability` is the test's sensitivity for that condition; otherwise the result is normal, apart
from `false_positive_rate`. `{value}` in a summary is replaced by a number from `value_range`.
`category` is `bedside`, `blood` or `imaging`; blood tests are sent to the lab and come back after
`turnaround_minutes`. Imaging tests also name their `room` (`x_ray` or `ct`): they are done there
by a radiographer and reported after `turnaround_minutes`, and can't be ordered without that room. `applies_to_sex` can restrict a test (e.g. pregnancy test: `female`).

### How to add a medication

Add an entry to any file in `game/Data/Medications/`:

```json
{
  "id": "aspirin",
  "name": "Aspirin",
  "drug_class": "Antiplatelet",
  "route": "oral",
  "typical_dose": "300 mg loading dose",
  "indications": "Suspected acute coronary syndrome.",
  "contraindications": "Aspirin allergy, active bleeding.",
  "allergy_groups": ["aspirin", "nsaid"],
  "common_side_effects": ["Indigestion", "Bleeding"],
  "cost_per_dose": 1
}
```

Before giving a medicine, staff check the patient's allergies against `allergy_groups` and
withhold it if they match. Patient allergies come from `game/Data/PatientBackgrounds/`.

### Names, arrivals and patient backgrounds

- `Names/` holds first names and surnames used for patients and staff.
- `Arrivals/` sets the expected arrivals for each hour of the day (`hourly_arrivals`, 24 numbers)
  and a multiplier per weekday.
- `PatientBackgrounds/` lists past medical history, regular medications and allergies, with how
  likely each is at different ages.

### Clinics

- `Clinics/` has one entry per clinic room template (`id` matches the template): `appointment_minutes`,
  `tariff` (paid per patient seen), the `reasons` patients are booked for, and `female_only` for
  gynaecology. Optional `procedures` (each with `name`, `minutes` and `tariff`) and `procedure_share`
  (the share of booked appointments that are procedures) add outpatient procedures. Loading checks every clinic room template has an entry.

### Room templates and furniture

- `Furniture/` lists each item with its real size (`width_m`, `depth_m`, `height_m`), how it is
  drawn (`box`, `chair`, `bed` or `monitor`), colour, cost and whether it is medical equipment.
- `RoomTemplates/` lists each room: `kind` (what the simulation uses it for), `layout` (how it is
  furnished: `bed_space`, `triage`, `waiting`, `office`, `staff_room` or `none` for corridors),
  example `sizes` (shown in the menu), minimum and maximum width and length in metres, door width, costs, staffing text
  and the furniture it may use. Loading checks every furniture id exists and that each layout has
  the items it needs.

### Adding a new content type (for developers)

1. Add a model class in `src/BlueprintSchool.Simulation/Data/Models/` implementing `IDataRecord`,
   with a `Validate` method that checks each field.
2. Add a folder constant and a `RecordLoader.LoadFolder<T>` call in `GameDatabase.Load`, plus any
   cross-reference checks.
3. Create the folder under `game/Data/` and add tests in `tests/`.

## Measurements

All sizes are stored in metres. One grid tile is **0.5 m × 0.5 m** (`Units.MetresPerTile`).
The starter hospital building is 30 m × 20 m on an 80 m × 60 m site.
