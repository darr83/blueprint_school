"""Makes the tannoy announcements with ElevenLabs text to speech.

    python3 tools/SoundBaker/generate_pa.py --list              # write pa_lines.json and count characters (free)
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... python3 tools/SoundBaker/generate_pa.py [--voices f,m] [key ...]

Every line is recorded once per announcer voice (f = female, m = male) into takes/pa/<key>_<voice>.mp3
(not committed), then converted to game/Audio/Sounds/pa/<key>_<voice>.ogg with silence trimmed and
loudness evened out. The tannoy speaker sound is added in the game (Announcements bus), not baked in.
Existing takes are skipped, so re-running never spends credits twice. Needs ffmpeg.

The keys match the clip names the simulation sends (SchoolSimulation.Announcements.cs):
call_<doctor|registrar|consultant>_resus_<1-6|x>, arrest_<resus_N|majors|ae|ward template id|room>, paed_arrest, obstetric_emergency,
trauma_<resus_N|resus_x>, amb_due_<5|10>, assess_<condition id>, gen_<name>.
